    <summary><strong>Financial Technology and Monetary Policy Design in Zimbabwe</strong> â€“ 2018</summary>
    <p><em>Abstract:</em> The recent wave of financial innovation that has followed the financial inclusion strategy adopted by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe in 2015 poses a serious challenge to the national payments system and the conduct of effective monetary policy in the country. Despite the resultant reduction in financial frictions in settling domestic financial transaction, the possibility of creating new endogenous money in the economy should be closely monitored, and the Reserve Bank should consider making comprehensive national payment systems reforms that are consummate with changing dynamics in the globalized financial systems while considering adopting digital currency given that its hegemony on monetary creation is nearing its terminal. If this is not expediently, adequately and timely considered, new risks to monetary policy coordination and hence financial stability will follow, reversing all the gains realized during the initial stages of the financial inclusion strategy in Zimbabwe.

    <summary><strong>Testing the Quantity Equation of Exchange in Zimbabwe</strong> â€“ European Journal of Business and Economics, 2019</summary>
    <p><em>Abstract:</em> This study investigates the effects of fiscal and current account imbalances on broad money growth in Zimbabwe using a Vector Autoregression (VAR) framework. The analysis is based on monthly time series data spanning from January 2010 to December 2017. Unit root tests at an optimal lag order of two revealed that both overall fiscal and current account balances follow a unit root process, while the primary variable of interest, broad money supply, is integrated of order one. Granger causality tests, conducted using Wald statistics, indicate that combined lags of fiscal deficits and current account deficits Granger-cause variations in money supply. Impulse response functions over an eight-month horizon show that fiscal expansion leads to an increase in money supply during the second and third periods, before gradually returning to equilibrium. Conversely, widening current account deficits have a liquidity-draining effect on the financial sector, largely through a reduction in Net Foreign Assets (NFA), exerting quantitative tightening pressures and adversely affecting asset price formation. Following external sector shocks, money supply also tends to revert to its equilibrium after the second period. The results are robust across alternative model specifications and provide key insights for monetary authorities in designing coordinated macroeconomic stabilization policies.</p>

    <summary><strong>Financing the Social Sector in Zimbabweâ€™s Post-Mugabe Eraâ€”Obstacles and Opportunities</strong> â€“ Smart Manda & Admire Tarisirayi Chirume</summary>
    <p><em>Abstract:</em> This chapter reviews the trends in social sector outcomes in Zimbabwe and assesses the financing challenges in the post-Mugabe era. While Zimbabwe made significant progress in developing its social sectors in the post-independence era, the economic crisis experienced from 1998 to 2008 reversed some of the gains that had been achieved. When the country adopted a multiple currency system in 2009, social sector outcomes improved, driven by a favourable macroeconomic environment. From 2016, however, the countryâ€™s economic fortunes reversed as the economy began to experience renewed challenges, including falling revenues and declining fiscal space, and shortage of foreign currency to import critical drugs, among other factors. In addition, continued depreciation of the domestic currency since its introduction in 2019 presented additional challenges to the Second Republic, as peopleâ€™s incomes were eroded while fiscal space continued to be squeezed. The situation was further exacerbated by the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic which affected both the education and health sectors in negative ways. These developments underlined the need for additional financing requirements to close the widening financing gap in social sectors in Zimbabwe. As this chapter shows, some of the possible financing options include broadening the tax base to unlock additional resources particularly from the informal economy, exploring contributory schemes, tapping into international financial assistance, strengthening publicâ€“private partnerships and tapping into diaspora remittances. There is also a need for strengthening public institutions to ensure efficiency and effectiveness in utilisation of public funds earmarked for social sectors.

  <summary><strong>Revisiting Uncovered Interest Parity in a Dollarized and Inflation-Prone Economy: Evidence and Insights from Zimbabwe</strong> â€“ Submitted to Journal of Mathematical Finance (JMF), 2025 (Paper ID: 1491175)</summary>
  <p><em>Abstract:</em> This paper investigates the failure of the Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP) condition in Zimbabwe, a country with a highly dollarized and inflation-prone economy. While UIP theoretically links interest rate differentials to expected exchange rate changes, Zimbabwe's economic environmentâ€”characterized by high inflation expectations, policy credibility gaps, and parallel market distortionsâ€”regularly violates UIP assumptions. This study aims to examine the empirical and theoretical breakdowns of UIP using adaptive and rational expectations frameworks and introduces a modified risk-adjusted UIP model. The objective is to quantify and interpret the persistent deviations from UIP and provide insights into the policy implications for exchange rate stabilization. The paper contributes to the literature by offering a context-specific analysis of UIP in a structurally weak and dollarized economy and recommends policy frameworks that go beyond interest rate adjustments.</p>

  <summary><strong>Informalization, Money Laundering, and Exchange Rate Stability in Zimbabwe: A Review of Literature</strong> â€“ Submitted to American Journal of Industrial and Business Management (AJIBM), 2025 (Co-authored with Takudzwa Moses Dzingayi-Tembo and Kelly Tinotenda Mupawaenda; Paper ID: 2123679)</summary>
  <p><em>Abstract:</em> Zimbabwe's economic instability, characterized by exchange rate volatility and inflation, is exacerbated by informalization and money laundering. This study examines how illicit financial flows distort currency markets, weaken monetary policy, and fuel poverty. Using a theoretical and mathematical framework, it analyzes the linkages between informal economic activities, financial opacity, and exchange rate instability. Findings highlight the disproportionate impact on women and the need for institutional reforms. Strengthening financial oversight, formalizing the economy, and implementing gender-sensitive policies are essential for restoring stability and promoting inclusive economic growth.</p>

  <summary><strong>Climate Change Shocks and Monetary Policy in South Africa: A Simulation-Based Analysis</strong> â€“ 2025 (Working Paper, Under Review)</summary>
  <p><em>Authors:</em> Chirume Admire Tarisirayi, Hurungo James, Chinoperekweyi Brandon Aaron</p>
  <p><em>Abstract:</em> This study explores the effects of climate shocks on South Africa's macroeconomic stability and monetary policy dynamics through a simulation-based DSGE model. It incorporates climate variability as a key factor influencing inflation expectations, output, and other macroeconomic variables. The analysis examines how climate-induced disruptionsâ€”such as changes in agricultural productivity, natural disasters, and environmental conditionsâ€”affect inflation, employment, exchange rates, and interest rates over a six-year horizon (2025â€“2030). The findings reveal that climate variability significantly impacts inflation expectations and economic output, necessitating adaptive monetary policies that incorporate climate risks. The study underscores the importance of integrating climate considerations into macroeconomic frameworks to enhance the resilience of South Africaâ€™s economy, emphasizing policy measures such as interest rate adjustments, climate-informed inflation targeting, and long-term strategic planning to mitigate climate-related economic disruptions.</p>

  <summary><strong>Estimating Potential Output and Output Gap in Zimbabwe: A Structural Production Function Approach</strong> â€“ 2025-03-25 (Not Yet Submitted)</summary>
  <p><em>Abstract:</em> This paper estimates Zimbabweâ€™s potential output and output gap using a structurally adjusted production function approach. Conventional methods such as the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter and Kalman filter, while popular, are theoretically and empirically inadequate for capturing the persistent structural distortions characterizing Zimbabweâ€™s economy. These filters misidentify permanent supply shocks as temporary, leading to biased estimates of the output gap and misguided policy responses.</p>
  <p>To address this, we augment the standard Cobb-Douglas production function to adjust labor and capital inputs for quality, informality, and utilization, and model total factor productivity (TFP) as a function of structural variables. Our results show that the structural model captures large, persistent negative output gaps during periods of macroeconomic crisis (e.g., 2000â€“2009) and provides more realistic estimates of Zimbabwe

  <summary><strong>Modeling the Monetary Expansion in Zimbabwe: A Time-Dynamic Approach</strong> â€“ 2025 (Not Yet Submitted)</summary>
  <p><em>Abstract:</em> This study models the time-dynamic behavior of the money multiplier in Zimbabwe, a country characterized by exchange rate volatility, inflationary pressures, and weak financial intermediation. By incorporating structural variables such as inflation expectations, exchange rate volatility, and banking confidence, we develop an extended functional form of the multiplier, <strong>M(T)</strong>.</p>

  <p>Using nonlinear least squares, we estimate the adjustment speed parameter, <strong>Î»</strong>, which governs how quickly injected base money translates into broad money supply. Empirical results show that, under prevailing macroeconomic conditions, it takes approximately 22â€“23 months for 99% of a monetary injection to fully expand through the financial system.</p>

  <p>These findings highlight the presence of significant lags in the transmission mechanism, offering critical insights into the timing and effectiveness of monetary policy interventions in high-risk, partially dollarized economies like Zimbabwe.</p>

  <summary><strong>Financial Technology and Monetary Policy Design in Zimbabwe</strong> â€“ 2018</summary>
  <p><em>Abstract:</em> The recent wave of financial innovation following Zimbabweâ€™s financial inclusion strategy (2015) presents new challenges to the national payments system and the effectiveness of monetary policy. While these fintech developments enhance transaction efficiency, they also risk introducing uncontrolled endogenous money creation.</p>

  <p>This paper argues for urgent national payments reform and explores the potential role of central bank digital currency (CBDC) as a tool to preserve monetary sovereignty and financial stability.</p>
