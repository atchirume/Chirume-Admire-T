    <summary><strong>Financial Technology and Monetary Policy Design in Zimbabwe</strong> – 2018</summary>
      <p><em>Abstract:</em> The recent wave of financial innovation that has followed the financial inclusion strategy adopted by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe in 2015 poses a serious challenge to the national payments system and the conduct of effective monetary policy in the country. Despite the resultant reduction in financial frictions in settling domestic financial transaction, the possibility of creating new endogenous money in the economy should be closely monitored, and the Reserve Bank should consider making comprehensive national payment systems reforms that are consummate with changing dynamics in the globalized financial systems while considering adopting digital currency given that its hegemony on monetary creation is nearing its terminal. If this is not expediently, adequately and timely considered, new risks to monetary policy coordination and hence financial stability will follow, reversing all the gains realized during the initial stages of the financial inclusion strategy in Zimbabwe.

  <summary><strong>Revisiting Uncovered Interest Parity in a Dollarized and Inflation-Prone Economy: Evidence and Insights from Zimbabwe</strong> – Submitted to Journal of Mathematical Finance (JMF), 2025 (Paper ID: 1491175)</summary>
  <p><em>Abstract:</em> This paper investigates the failure of the Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP) condition in Zimbabwe, a country with a highly dollarized and inflation-prone economy. While UIP theoretically links interest rate differentials to expected exchange rate changes, Zimbabwe's economic environment—characterized by high inflation expectations, policy credibility gaps, and parallel market distortions—regularly violates UIP assumptions. This study aims to examine the empirical and theoretical breakdowns of UIP using adaptive and rational expectations frameworks and introduces a modified risk-adjusted UIP model. The objective is to quantify and interpret the persistent deviations from UIP and provide insights into the policy implications for exchange rate stabilization. The paper contributes to the literature by offering a context-specific analysis of UIP in a structurally weak and dollarized economy and recommends policy frameworks that go beyond interest rate adjustments.</p>

  <summary><strong>Informalization, Money Laundering, and Exchange Rate Stability in Zimbabwe: A Review of Literature</strong> – Submitted to American Journal of Industrial and Business Management (AJIBM), 2025 (Co-authored with Takudzwa Moses Dzingayi-Tembo and Kelly Tinotenda Mupawaenda; Paper ID: 2123679)</summary>
  <p><em>Abstract:</em> Zimbabwe's economic instability, characterized by exchange rate volatility and inflation, is exacerbated by informalization and money laundering. This study examines how illicit financial flows distort currency markets, weaken monetary policy, and fuel poverty. Using a theoretical and mathematical framework, it analyzes the linkages between informal economic activities, financial opacity, and exchange rate instability. Findings highlight the disproportionate impact on women and the need for institutional reforms. Strengthening financial oversight, formalizing the economy, and implementing gender-sensitive policies are essential for restoring stability and promoting inclusive economic growth.</p>

  <summary><strong>Climate Change Shocks and Monetary Policy in South Africa: A Simulation-Based Analysis</strong> – 2025 (Working Paper, Under Review)</summary>
  <p><em>Authors:</em> Chirume Admire Tarisirayi, Hurungo James, Chinoperekweyi Brandon Aaron</p>
  <p><em>Abstract:</em> This study explores the effects of climate shocks on South Africa's macroeconomic stability and monetary policy dynamics through a simulation-based DSGE model. It incorporates climate variability as a key factor influencing inflation expectations, output, and other macroeconomic variables. The analysis examines how climate-induced disruptions—such as changes in agricultural productivity, natural disasters, and environmental conditions—affect inflation, employment, exchange rates, and interest rates over a six-year horizon (2025–2030). The findings reveal that climate variability significantly impacts inflation expectations and economic output, necessitating adaptive monetary policies that incorporate climate risks. The study underscores the importance of integrating climate considerations into macroeconomic frameworks to enhance the resilience of South Africa’s economy, emphasizing policy measures such as interest rate adjustments, climate-informed inflation targeting, and long-term strategic planning to mitigate climate-related economic disruptions.</p>

  <summary><strong>Basic Econometric Model for Benchmark Rate Determination in Zimbabwe</strong> – 2023 (Unpublished)</summary>
  <p><em>Abstract:</em> This paper develops a basic econometric framework for estimating the benchmark interest rate in Zimbabwe using inflation trends, credit growth, and monetary aggregates. It aims to support evidence-based rate setting in an unstable macro-financial environment.</p>

  <summary><strong>Estimating Potential Output and Output Gap in Zimbabwe: A Structural Production Function Approach</strong> – 2025-03-25 (Not Yet Submitted)</summary>
  <p><em>Abstract:</em> This paper estimates Zimbabwe’s potential output and output gap using a structurally adjusted production function approach. Conventional methods such as the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter and Kalman filter, while popular, are theoretically and empirically inadequate for capturing the persistent structural distortions characterizing Zimbabwe’s economy. These filters misidentify permanent supply shocks as temporary, leading to biased estimates of the output gap and misguided policy responses.</p>
  <p>To address this, we augment the standard Cobb-Douglas production function to adjust labor and capital inputs for quality, informality, and utilization, and model total factor productivity (TFP) as a function of structural variables. Our results show that the structural model captures large, persistent negative output gaps during periods of macroeconomic crisis (e.g., 2000–2009) and provides more realistic estimates of Zimbabwe

  <summary><strong>Modeling the Monetary Expansion in Zimbabwe: A Time-Dynamic Approach</strong> – 2025 (Not Yet Submitted)</summary>
  <p><em>Abstract:</em> This study models the time-dynamic behavior of the money multiplier in Zimbabwe, a country characterized by exchange rate volatility, inflationary pressures, and weak financial intermediation. By incorporating structural variables such as inflation expectations, exchange rate volatility, and banking confidence, we develop an extended functional form of the multiplier, <strong>M(T)</strong>.</p>

  <p>Using nonlinear least squares, we estimate the adjustment speed parameter, <strong>λ</strong>, which governs how quickly injected base money translates into broad money supply. Empirical results show that, under prevailing macroeconomic conditions, it takes approximately 22–23 months for 99% of a monetary injection to fully expand through the financial system.</p>

  <p>These findings highlight the presence of significant lags in the transmission mechanism, offering critical insights into the timing and effectiveness of monetary policy interventions in high-risk, partially dollarized economies like Zimbabwe.</p>

  <summary><strong>Financial Technology and Monetary Policy Design in Zimbabwe</strong> – 2018</summary>
  <p><em>Abstract:</em> The recent wave of financial innovation following Zimbabwe’s financial inclusion strategy (2015) presents new challenges to the national payments system and the effectiveness of monetary policy. While these fintech developments enhance transaction efficiency, they also risk introducing uncontrolled endogenous money creation.</p>

  <p>This paper argues for urgent national payments reform and explores the potential role of central bank digital currency (CBDC) as a tool to preserve monetary sovereignty and financial stability.</p>
